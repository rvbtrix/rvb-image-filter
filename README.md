# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

I had a problem with Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk finishing my project 2, so I decided to deploy the project with just the filter image, and I was successful.
So there are 2 projects in the Git hub
1 - https://github.com/rvbtrix/rvb-image-filter
-- This content is the entire implementation, and includes the Image Filter with Authentication
-- This was not implemented, I don't know why, I tried many things but I couldn't, I imagine the problem could be a package that EB doesn't understand

2 - https://github.com/rvbtrix/image-filter-only
-- Contains only the filter image with authentication
-- This has been deployed
-- http://imagefilterrvb-dev.eba-qnybtq5n.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?img_url=
